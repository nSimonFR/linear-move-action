# Linear Move

Moves a [linear.app](https://linear.app) list of issues `from` one state `to` another.

If no `from`, issues will be moved to `to` regardless of their previous states.

For example, takes a list of Github PRs as linear `attachments` _(Allowing extension of the [Github X Linear integration](https://linear.app/docs/github))_.

See my other linear projects over here => https://github.com/nSimonFR/linear-tools
